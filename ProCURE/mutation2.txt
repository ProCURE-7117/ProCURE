### Instruction ###
Please identify two independent statement blocks in the following code and swap their positions. 
These blocks should be independent of each other to ensure that the modified code remains grammatically correct and semantically equivalent to the original. 
If no such independent blocks are found, leave the code unchanged.

### Original Code ###
Here is the code you need to modify:
$code$
Please output the modified code without any explaination!

### Processing Steps ###
1.Identification Phase： 
- Find all the definition and usage point of the statements
- Select a pair of statements with independent control flow as the conversion target
2.Swap Phase：
- Exchange the selected pair of statements 
3.Validation Phase：  
- Confirm semantic equivalence through control flow analysis  
- Ensure no syntax errors introduced

### Example ###
**example input**
def quick_sort(lst):  
    n = len(lst)
    if n <= 1:
        return lst
    baseline = lst[0] 
    left = [lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)) if lst[i] < baseline] 
    right = [lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)) if lst[i] >= baseline]
    return quick_sort(left) + [baseline] + quick_sort(right)

**example output**
def quick_sort(lst):  
    n = len(lst)
    if n <= 1:
        return lst
    baseline = lst[0]
    right = [lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)) if lst[i] >= baseline]
    left = [lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)) if lst[i] < baseline] 
    return quick_sort(left) + [baseline] + quick_sort(right)
